## üßæ How It Works

1. **Smart Ticker Selection**
   - Fetches S&P 500 and Nasdaq tickers
   - Filters based on:
     - Market Cap > $100M
     - Average Volume > 100K
     - Major exchanges only (NYSE/Nasdaq)
   - Reduces initial scan from 6000+ to ~800-1000 quality stocks

2. **Efficient Data Management**
   - Implements smart caching system
   - Caches stock data for 24 hours
   - Stores scan results for 12 hours
   - Reduces API calls by 80-90%
   - Automatically manages cache updates

3. **Scanning Process**
   - Scans filtered tickers in parallel batches
   - Calculates:
     - 5-day RSI
     - Price drops from 5-day high
     - Volume analysis
   - Scores stocks based on multiple criteria
   - Updates progress in real-time

4. **Results Management**
   - Maintains 7-day watchlist
   - Logs "Perfect Buy" opportunities
   - Saves daily scan results
   - Tracks cache performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è To Run It

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas requests beautifulsoup4
```

Then simply run:

```bash
python tracker.py
```

The bot will:
1. Check for recent cached results
2. Use cache if available (within 12 hours)
3. Perform new scan if needed
4. Save results to `output/` directory
5. Update watchlist automatically

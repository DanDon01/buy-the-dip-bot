üéØ Essential Metrics for Dip-Hunting Greatness
Here‚Äôs your hitlist of indicators to filter the fallen angels from the trash fires:

1. % Below 52-Week High
üü¢ Great for: Identifying stocks off their recent highs.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Sweet spot: 15%‚Äì40% drop ‚Äî enough to be oversold, not enough to signal death.

2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
üü¢ Great for: Short-term exhaustion.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Look for RSI < 30 (ideally RSI(5) or RSI(14)) ‚Äî often signals capitulation.

üîç Optional: RSI divergence vs price can show hidden reversal setups.

3. Volume Spike
üü¢ Great for: Detecting shakeouts or forced selling.

‚ú≥Ô∏è A recent 1.5x‚Äì3x volume burst vs average can suggest final panic selling or institutional activity.

4. Price vs Moving Averages
üü¢ Great for: Trend positioning.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Dipping just below the 50-day or 200-day SMA may suggest temporary weakness.

‚úÖ Reclaiming moving averages is often the first sign of a bounce.

5. MACD Bullish Cross
üü¢ Great for: Momentum shifts.

‚ú≥Ô∏è A recent MACD crossover after a decline often precedes short- to mid-term bounces.

6. Low P/E (but not too low)
üü¢ Great for: Screening out overhyped junk.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Look for P/E below sector average, but not sub-5 unless it's a dividend play.

7. High Free Cash Flow (FCF) or Positive Earnings Growth
üü¢ Great for: Underlying business quality.

‚ú≥Ô∏è You want to dip-buy quality ‚Äî not flaming debt piles.

8. Low Short Float
üü¢ Great for: Avoiding meme-chop.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Under 5‚Äì10% is safe. High short float = risk of crowding or manipulation.

9. Insider Buying
üü¢ Great for: Confidence signals.

‚ú≥Ô∏è If execs are buying while prices are down = üö®green flag.

10. Sector Context
üü¢ Great for: Macro backdrop.

‚ú≥Ô∏è If the whole sector dipped (e.g. tech sell-off), the good ones rebound first.

üß† Bonus Signs It‚Äôs a Dip, Not a Dumpster:
üîÑ Recent downtrend slowing (smaller red candles, tighter ranges)

üí¨ No disastrous news ‚Äî just rotation or profit-taking

üìà Long-term uptrend still intact on the weekly chart

üíº Analyst upgrades during the dip

üó∫Ô∏è A roadmap for turning those metrics into a ‚Äúcream-skimming‚Äù score
Layer	Purpose	Typical Weighting*	What you‚Äôre really asking
1. Quality Gate	Weed out garbage before you even think about momentum	30‚Äì40 % of final score	‚ÄúIs this a business I‚Äôd want to own at any price?‚Äù
2. Dip Signal	Measure how far and how fast it‚Äôs fallen	40‚Äì50 %	‚ÄúIs this a temporary bruise or a structural break?‚Äù
3. Reversal Spark	Detect the first hints of a turn-up	10‚Äì20 %	‚ÄúIs the selling pressure exhausting and buying pressure emerging?‚Äù
4. Risk/Context Mods	Adjust for sector, liquidity, macro noise	-10 % ‚Üí +10 %	‚ÄúShould I nudge this up or down given the backdrop?‚Äù

*Use these as starting ranges‚Äîtweak in back-tests.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Quality Gate (worth ~‚Öì of the pie)
Metric	Why it matters	Suggested rule of thumb
Positive free-cash-flow trend	Cash keeps the lights on	Must be positive YoY or ‚â• sector median
Reasonable P/E / PEG	Overpriced ‚Äúdips‚Äù often keep dipping	P/E < sector √ó 1.2 and PEG < 2
Debt / EBITDA	High leverage = shaky rebounds	Ideally < 3
Insider / buy-back activity	Skin-in-the-game confidence	Neutral ‚Üí + bonus points if recent insider buys

üëü If a stock fails two quality checks, boot it before scoring the dip.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Dip Signal (the meat, ~¬Ω of score)
Metric	Scoring idea	Sweet zone
% below 52-week high	Map 10 %‚Üí0 pts, 45 %‚Üímax pts	20‚Äì40 % drop
RSI(14)	Linear inverse scale 40‚Üí0 pts, 25‚Üímax pts	25‚Äì35
Volume spike	1√óavg‚Üí0 pts, 2.5√óavg‚Üímax pts	1.5‚Äì3√ó
SMA crossover	Price < SMA50 but > SMA200 gets bonus	Tells you ‚Äútemporary pullback‚Äù

Weight these so none single-handedly dominates‚Äîe.g. 15 pts each, capped at 45 total.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reversal Spark (momentum clues, ~‚Öï)
Trigger	Points	Rationale
MACD bullish cross in last 5 days	+5	Early momentum shift
Hammer / pin-bar candle within last 3 sessions	+5	Exhaustion wick
Positive earnings surprise during dip	+5	Fresh catalyst

(Give zero if the opposite trigger appears.)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Risk / Context Mods
Modifier	Adjustment
Sector is already in confirmed up-swing	√ó1.1 multiplier
High short float (>15 %)	‚àí5 pts
Beta > 2 and VIX > 20	‚àí5 pts
Fed decision week, earnings in < 3 days	‚àíTEMPORARILY exclude

These keep you from ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù filling the list with meme-stocks or macro-trap setups.

üîß Tuning methodology
Historical back-test

Apply the scoring model to past data (e.g. 2020-2024).

Record 1- and 3-month forward returns of top 20 scorers.

Adjust weights until the top bucket beats SPX by X %.

Walk-forward validation

Re-run monthly on unseen months; watch hit-rate and draw-downs.

Aim for >60 % winners and max 10 % worst-case drop.

Regular Kaizen

Every quarter, retune: sectors rotate, macro shifts, what ‚Äúdip‚Äù means evolves.

Keep a changelog so you know why a weight was altered.

Human sanity check

Glance at the leaderboard: if perennial zombies show up, tighten quality gate.

If only mega-caps appear, relax the market-cap floor or volume filter.

üèÅ Practical rule-of-thumb weights to start
Layer	Points out of 100
Quality Gate	30
Dip Signal	45
Reversal Spark	15
Risk Mods	¬±10
